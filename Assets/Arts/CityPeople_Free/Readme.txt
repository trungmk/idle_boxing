■ To use Mixamo animations

By following the steps below, you can obtain animation clips that are perfectly matched to the rig of the models included in this package.

1. Upload the included FBX file directly to Mixamo.

2. Choose any animation and download it with skin.

3. Import the downloaded FBX into your Unity project.

4. To use the downloaded FBX directly,
   assign a material to the mesh and set the Rig to Humanoid.
   Then, drag and drop the animation clip onto the character in the    Scene —
   Unity will automatically create an Animator and apply the animation.

5. If you want to combine it with other animation clips,
   you can copy and separate the animation clip from the imported FBX.
   This clip can be used with the included prefabs by dragging it onto the prefab,
   or added to any custom Animator Controller.

Note:
When setting the rig to Humanoid, make sure all bones are correctly assigned in the Configure window.
Occasionally, optional bones such as Chest may not be auto-assigned and may need to be set manually.
